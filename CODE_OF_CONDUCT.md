# Code of Conduct

## The short version

Be respectful. Be constructive. Don't waste people's time.

## The longer version

This project is maintained by one person in their free time. Contributions are welcome, but this isn't a democracy — final decisions rest with the maintainer.

**Do:**
- Report bugs with steps to reproduce
- Submit clean, focused patches
- Respect that "no" is a complete answer

**Don't:**
- Demand features or timelines
- Be hostile, dismissive, or condescending
- Derail issues with unrelated discussion

Violators get one warning, then a ban. No appeals process. Life's too short.

## Scope

This applies to all project spaces: issues, PRs, and discussions.
